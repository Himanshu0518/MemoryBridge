    Person represents an individual recognized by the system.

    Relationship:
    - One Patient can have many Persons around them.
    - One Person can have many FaceEmbeddings.
    Important:
    A Person can be either a KnownPerson or an UnknownFace.
    - KnownPerson: someone the caregiver has identified (e.g. "Alice, daughter")
    - UnknownFace: someone the system has seen but not identified (e.g. "Unknown #5")
    This allows the system to track and recognize faces even if they haven't been identified yet.
    Once a caregiver identifies an UnknownFace, it can be converted to a KnownPerson.

    FaceEmbedding stores mathematical face vectors for recognition.

    Why separate table?
    Because one person should have multiple embeddings:
    - front face
    - left angle
    - right angle
    - different lighting

    This improves recognition accuracy.

    Many embeddings belong to one Person.
